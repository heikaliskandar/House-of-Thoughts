                        <p class="byline"><strong>By Isya Rohaili, 3/12/2024</strong></p>
                        <hr>
                        <!-- Horizontal line before the article starts -->

                        <p>Trump’s stance on contentious issues like immigration, healthcare, racial relations, and climate change has deepened divisions within the U.S., leaving many Americans feeling more alienated along ideological lines. A victory for
                            Trump in the earliest election could have sweeping impacts, both domestically and globally, with significant consequences for Malaysia as well. The implications could reach far beyond U.S. borders, impacting international norms
                            and shaping the policies of allied and neighbouring nations alike.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            "The nation and the world can expect the incoming Trump administration to take a wrecking ball to global climate diplomacy," said Rachel Cleetus, Policy Director and Lead Economist for the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Climate and Energy Program.
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>This sentiment is echoed in Trump’s "Drill, baby, drill" slogan, which encapsulates his push for greater U.S. energy independence through the expansion of oil and gas extraction. Despite increasing calls for a shift to cleaner
                            energy, there is little indication that Trump's administration will reduce America’s reliance on fossil fuels. In fact, he has pledged to intensify their use and eliminate all wind turbines across the country on the "first
                            day" of his presidency, signalling a clear commitment to prioritizing fossil fuels over renewable energy sources. With the world already grappling with environmental challenges, Trump’s policies could undermine collective global
                            efforts to address climate change and exacerbate existing tensions over environmental responsibility.</p>

                        <h2>Proposed Policies and Their Implications</h2>

                        <p>A glimpse into proposed policies reveals a landscape where foundational freedoms across the U.S. could be reshaped. Trump has pledged to reinstate his prior travel ban on refugees and travellers from several predominantly Muslim
                            countries. Additionally, he announced plans for what he calls the 'largest deportation program in history,' aiming to expel 'maybe as many as 20 million' people from the United States. These measures have drawn sharp criticism
                            from human rights advocates and immigration groups, who warn of deep social and humanitarian impacts.</p>

                        <p>For U.S. citizens, such a win could result in a rollback of civil liberties, with restrictions on abortion potentially expanding nationwide—impacting even blue states. One of the more far-reaching proposals from Project 2025, a
                            conservative policy plan, suggests using the Comstock Act of 1873, which bans the mailing of abortion-related materials, to outlaw the shipment of abortion pills. This could severely limit access to medication abortions, undermining
                            reproductive rights for millions of Americans.</p>

                        <h2>LGBTQ+ Rights Under Threat</h2>

                        <p>Meanwhile, an atmosphere of heightened prejudice might be exacerbated by the potential to rethink regulations that target the LGBTQ+ population. Amid growing concerns over the future of LGBTQ+ rights, Trump's administration may
                            revoke important safeguards for LGBTQ+ people, including prohibitions on discrimination in the workplace, the freedom to marry, and even access to healthcare. A notable example is Trump's tweet on July 26, 2017, announcing
                            that the U.S. military would no longer "accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity."</p>

                        <h2>Impact on Malaysia</h2>

                        <blockquote>
                            "I think any country in the world, given the influence that the US has on the global economy, would have carried out some sort of due diligence on whatever impacts a change in US administration would have on local economy and administration." - Mohd Rafizi
                            Ramli, Minister of Economy.
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>In 2022, trade in goods and services between the two nations reached $78 billion, with the U.S. also standing as Malaysia's largest foreign investor, creating over 312,000 Malaysian jobs in the past decade. As the U.S. heads toward
                            another presidential election, the potential impact on Malaysia's political and economic landscape is significant, underscoring the importance of monitoring developments in the race for the White House.</p>

                        <p>Trump’s policies favouring traditional energy sectors could benefit Malaysia's oil and gas industry, according to Moomoo Malaysia’s Senior Equity and Derivatives Dealer, Ahmad Fidauddin. Increased U.S. support for fossil fuels
                            and relaxed regulations may drive oil demand, aligning well with Malaysia’s strengths in the sector. "This will help the FTSE Bursa Malaysia (FBM) Energy Index, currently at around 840.90 points, as oil demand is expected to
                            rise," said Fidauddin.</p>
